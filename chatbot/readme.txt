To see this working...

- go to turntable.fm (if is asks you for a site password use "speakeasy")
- create an account (sorry)
- update authChat.js with the credentials you've been sent
- once your account has been verified go to https://turntable.fm/70s_80s_80s_awesomesauce
-- you'll see an empty room, probably, and be walked through some new user bits (that intro goes away once you have some points...the bot can help fix that!)
- start the chatbot with "node chatBot.js"
-- you'll see another user enter the room
-- it will start counting at you with a message number plus "tik" on odd numbers and "tok" on even numbers
- enter "/hello" into the chat (bottom right) and it'll say hello, plus your name and a message number
- type anything else in the chat and it should ignore you
